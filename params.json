{"name":"Generator-slim","tagline":"A Yo Generator which sets up a new, on the Slim Framework based, project.","body":"# Generator-slim\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/katywings/generator-slim.png)](https://travis-ci.org/katywings/generator-slim)\r\n\r\nThis yeoman generator sets up a PHP Project including [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com), all needed configs to begin with developing and several grunt tasks. Yes its a PHP Project Generator and automatically downloads composer and several php libs for fast prototyping.\r\n\r\n(based on the yeoman [generator-generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-generator))\r\n\r\nFor the client part, ive included Backbone and Marionette. Coffeescript and Less are integrated in app/src and automatically builded and minified into the public folder.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed: `sudo npm install -g yo`\r\n- Install the generator: `sudo npm install -g generator-slim`\r\n- Run: `sudo yo slim`\r\n\r\n## Server Setup\r\n### Basic\r\nThe generator comes with a included server for php. For faster development, I added a watcher with build at change and livereload.\r\n- PHP 5.4 is prerequired! Install it first\r\n\t- [mac](http://php-osx.liip.ch)\r\n- Run: `grunt server`\r\n\r\n### Manual Installation\r\nIf you don't wanna use the included grunt server, you can use any Apache/PHP Webserver. To get your webserver to work with the project you need to change the following things:\r\n- Setup your Apache Webserver DocumentRoot to \"public/\"\r\n- Run: `grunt`\r\n- And to start the watcher: `grunt watch`\r\n\r\n## Switch between development and production\r\n- Run: `grunt production` to switch to production\r\n- Run: `grunt` or `grunt development` to switch back to development\r\n\r\n## Further Grunt Tasks\r\n### Building dist\r\nThe generated distribution includes just the needed files and is as small as possible. \r\n- Run: `grunt dist` to generate the dist\r\n- `grunt dist` changes automatically to production, run `grunt` if you wanna change back to development!\r\n\r\n### Fetching npm and bower modules\r\n- Run: `sudo grunt fetch`, WARNING: The downloaded files will have System as Owner!\r\n\r\n## License\r\n[MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
